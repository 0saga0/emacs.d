This is an emacs configuration tree that supports a number of programming languages,
particularly Ruby/Rails and other dynamic languages including Clojure, PHP, Python etc.

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the 'init.el' contained in
this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el.

Although these config files aren't meant to be a replacement for emacs-starter-kit,
some of the tips & tricks contained herein might be useful to others, and there are
flags at the top of init.el which can toggle certain features that might annoy people
who aren't me, e.g. the "viper" vi emulation.

I use Emacs from CVS on a Mac, but the config should work in other environments too.
