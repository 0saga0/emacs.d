This is an emacs configuration tree that supports a number of programming languages,
particularly Ruby/Rails and other dynamic languages including Clojure, PHP, Python etc.

In particular, I have a nice config for tab autocompletion, and flymake is used to
immediately highlight syntax errors in Ruby, HAML, Python, Javascript, PHP and some
other languages.

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the 'init.el' contained in
this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el.  Many of the required packages are included
as git submodules, so you'll need to "git submodule update --init" to check them out
initially, and "git submodule update" to keep them up-to-date over time.

Although these config files aren't meant to be a replacement for emacs-starter-kit,
some of the tips & tricks contained herein might be useful to others, and there are
flags at the top of init.el which can toggle certain features that might annoy people
who aren't me, e.g. the "viper" vi emulation.

I use Emacs from CVS on a Mac, but the config should work in other environments too.
